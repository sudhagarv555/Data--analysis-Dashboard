## Project Insight
The project highlights significant differences in sales performance and customer engagement between the two regions. The Primary Region shows higher sales and product diversity, indicating better market penetration. The Secondary Region has growth potential, with opportunities to improve customer outreach and product availability. Higher average sales per order in one region suggest a focus on premium products could be beneficial. Strategic efforts like targeted marketing and inventory optimization can help balance performance across both regions.
## Final Conculsion
The sales comparison shows that the Primary Region outperforms the Secondary Region in terms of total sales and customer engagement. However, the Secondary Region has higher potential for growth due to a smaller but emerging customer base. Average sales per order are higher in the Primary Region, indicating a preference for higher-value purchases. Product diversity is greater in the Primary Region, suggesting better inventory management. Targeted strategies, such as enhanced marketing and promotions, are recommended to improve performance in the Secondary Region.
